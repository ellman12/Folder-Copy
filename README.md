# Folder Copy
 Command Line Tool to automatically copy folders to a destination for easy backing up to an online service or elsewhere.

Something I often do is copying several "super important" folders to an external location like the cloud (in addition to a full PC backup). Things like video game save files, etc. So instead of having to go hunting for all of those folders every time I want to back them up, I made this little script to automate the process.
